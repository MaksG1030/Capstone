                DND character creator project proposal

    This project will be a dungeons and dragons character creator 
website, The main reason I feel this would be a good project to pursue
is that there are no websites that use the full content that dnd 
supplies.
    I will build it using react, I feel that it will be the best for me
to use, it is going to be more front-end focused. I am going to make it
a website that will be designed to help the users choose their races,  
classes and subclasses. When you choose a race it will pull the 
features from the api and add it to the users character sheet.
    The target user for the website are beginner and advanced dnd players
who are looking for a character creator that is quick and accurate,
the demographic would be considered nerds and ttrpg enthusiasts.
I am going to use a dnd api which has all the race and class data,
It has all the playable races and classes with subclasses and when a
user makes a selection it will pull all the important data that they will
need to know.
